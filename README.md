usbd-midi
=========

A simple usb midi device class for [usb-device](https://crates.io/crates/usb-device).

Currently this aims to be a very simple implementation, that allows the micro
controller to send midi information to the PC.

This crate requires the use of a hardware driver, that implements the
usb-device traits.
